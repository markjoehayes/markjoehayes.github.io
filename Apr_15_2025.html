		<h3>A Very Good Week</h3>
		<p>This week, I am changing the format of how I make this posts.  In the future, as I make longer posts, I&#39;d rather have links.<br>
		Anyway. I started to play around with nmap, wireshark and metasploit.  Very superficially but it is a start.  I learned how to capture packets in Wireshark, basically I just opened some web pages and looked for Hello and handshakes. I also ran several nmap scans on my home network, using various flags. Insofar as metasploit, I just installed a metasploitable vm and did a backdoor attack.  Fun, but not sure how practical, although it was my first day, more to come. Also, I realized I detest apt package manager! I plan to spin up an Arch VM and add the blackarch repository.  Goodbye Kali!

		<p>At Holberton: I suck on their multiple choice quizzes!  I was super prepared this week and still managed to score 77%! I am pretty sure they have lower weight, but still.  The next days are HUGE! I have to start my shell project.  I started reading on it yesterday and will (hopefully get some code in today.) We have until the 25th, but I&#39;d prefer to get it in earlier.  I am paired with the youngest guy in the program, I am pretty sure he doesn&#39;t like me, but who knows?  I have never seen him to talk to anyone else either. It seems we are just gonna split coding tasks and work on them independently.<br>Also, at Holberton, we will have our final interview in C. We will meet with the leaders and white board code for them.  I started preparing last week.  I am still low-confident with more advanced DSA, but I still have 9 days!<br>Lastly, I am trying to work through a dev ops course in Coursera in 7 days (before mt free trial ends!)</p>
