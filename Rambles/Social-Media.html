 <p>I watched <i>The Social Network</i> for the first time the other day. I know, I can't believe it took me so long either!
 If one believes the story as it is told, as do I, after later text messages resurfaced after the lawsuit. It appears that the 
 Zuc is a cold and calculating money worshiper by nature.  This struck me as I was always under the assumption that he started
 as an innocent prodigy who got corrupted once making it big. This isn't what I want to ramble about, just bringing it up as 
 this is what got me to thinking about the current state of social media, which I mostly don't use anymore - can't give up Reddit
 though.</p> 
 <br>
 <h3>Lets go waaaaay back:</h3>when the internet was fun and chats were all text.

 <p>As I start thinking of this, I must laugh, I remember going to Kinkos wiith an analog photo of myself to get scanned in, so
 I could have a picture in my chat profile. To us it was a magical time, even though a far cry from today's standards. Memory was 
 measured in MB and most non-essential storage (photos, school papers, etc) were stored on removable disks. Most of us didn't use 
 cell phones and those that did, would never use them before 9pm. Exchanging email addresses with new social contacts became the norm and 
 we would plan chats through Instant Messaging programs. There was no google! Yahoo had an early version of search, but it didn't crawl,
 websites were added in manually by subject. If you wanted to find smaller sites, you had to rely on webrings that most small website
 owners included on their webpages.  Webrings were list of links that the website owner recomended. This is where the term &quot;web surfing&quot;
 came from: you would move from page to page, relying on recomendations.  Where we efficiently (although loosing efficiency as companies prioritize
 profits) google today, back then we enjoyed web surfing aimlessly.  The term Corporate Surveillrence hadn't even been uttered yet, 
 at least not in my circles.  We were young, naive and in love with the ineternet.</p>

 <h3>Was I actually a defender of advertising?</h3> smple answer, yes!

<p>&quot;I don't use that site anynore too many adds!&quot;</p>

<p>I would hear this over and over again.  As someone who never made much income and has always been a terrible money manager, I would 
jump and quickly defend these evil advertisers.  Afterall did they prefer paying for these services.  The adds paid the bills and 
allowed us to email, AIM and chat all for the cost of a dialup internet connection. I would inforn everyone and anyone who would 
listen to me. If use went down, advertisers would leave and we would either not have anything for fun, or be forced to pay a monthly
fee.  I liked neither of those situations.</p>
