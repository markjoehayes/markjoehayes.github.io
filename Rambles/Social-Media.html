 <p>I watched <i>The Social Network</i> for the first time the other day. I know, I can't believe it took me so long either!
 If one believes the story as it is told, as do I, after later text messages resurfaced after the lawsuit. It appears that the 
 Zuc is a cold and calculating money worshiper by nature.  This struck me as I was always under the assumption that he started
 as an innocent prodigy who got corrupted once making it big. This isn't what I want to ramble about, just bringing it up as 
 this is what got me to thinking about the current state of social media, which I mostly don't use anymore - can't give up Reddit
 though.</p> 
 <br>
 <h3>Lets go waaaaay back:</h3>when the internet was fun and chats were all text.

 <p>As I start thinking of this, I must laugh, I remember going to Kinkos with an analog photo of myself to get scanned in, so
 I could have a picture in my chat profile. To us it was a magical time, even though a far cry from today's standards. Memory was 
 measured in MB and most non-essential storage (photos, school papers, etc) were stored on removable disks. Most of us didn't use 
 cell phones and those that did, would never use them before 9pm. Exchanging email addresses with new social contacts became the norm and 
 we would plan chats through Instant Messaging programs. There was no google! Yahoo had an early version of search, but it didn't crawl,
 websites were added in manually by subject. If you wanted to find smaller sites, you had to rely on webrings that most small website
 owners included on their webpages.  Webrings were list of links that the website owner recommended. This is where the term &quot;web surfing&quot;
 came from: you would move from page to page, relying on recommendations.  Where we efficiently (although loosing efficiency as companies prioritize
 profits) google today, back then we enjoyed web surfing aimlessly.  The term Corporate Surveillance hadn't even been uttered yet, 
 at least not in my circles.  We were young, naive and in love with the internet.</p>

 <h3>Was I actually a defender of advertising?</h3> sample answer, yes!

<p>&quot;I don't use that site anymore too many adds!&quot;</p>

<p>I would hear this over and over again.  As someone who never made much income and has always been a terrible money manager, I would 
jump and quickly defend these evil advertisers.  After all did they prefer paying for these services.  The adds paid the bills and 
allowed us to email, AIM and chat all for the cost of a dial-up internet connection. I would inform everyone and anyone who would 
listen to me. If use went down, advertisers would leave and we would either not have anything for fun, or be forced to pay a monthly
fee.  I liked neither of those situations. By this point we were using Myspace, which I miss dearly. I loved having my own separate page, 
blinging it out (we all had our own look, unlike today's monotonous newsfeed style social media'), and to the ire of many, having  a song play
when you opened my page (In those days most of us still did all our interneting at work). When facebook opened to everyone, everyone migrated at 
once, Myspace became such a lonely place, I tried to hold out as long as I could, but eventually there was no point in posting vacation 
pictures when there was nobody to believe my vacation was better then it actually was.</p>

<h3>Then something weird happened</h3>

<p>The flashing side panels of adds went away with ugly UI's of the early 2000s, yet these internet companies were making more than ever.
The distracting adds were replaced with something much worse. Targeted adds. The scariest part is the reason why most people are unbothered:
you can't see it like an annoying pop up window, it subtle, yet much more lucrative.  After years of oversharing online in the guise of
"coming together" (that could be another essay), the corporations figured out the value. Our data could be sold for at a premium.  This 
is beyond letting you know of an upcoming sale or a new product that nobody years. This became psychologically manipulative. The data collected 
could interpret our moods and when we were mostly likely to overspend and on what kinds of products.  Rather than a generic banner add, we would have 
very specific products show up only in our searches based on how we felt that day.  In the documentary, <i>The Creepy Line</i> one of the original
founders of google was explaining what could be done with data they collected.  The interviewer asks him, &quot;Are you saying that you can know
what mood I am in?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I can know much, much more than that!  Our goal is to get right up to the creepy line, but not cross it&quot;</p>
<p>Just as the <i>Don't be Evil'</i>motto of 2000s google was quietly dropped, it seems the creepy they didn't want to cross in 2010s is
no problem today. Is it that we need guardrails on capitalism?</p>

<h3>Speaking of Capitalism...</h3>

<p>As Facebook is being called to another congressional show, I mean, investigation to see if they have a monopoly in the coming weeks it makes
me remember my primary school and the superficial lessons on capitalism.  It benefits the people by creating competition, we were told.  The 
free markets will force competitors to make better products and bring prices down. Sounds great, yet what do we see with Meta?  We don't have 
typical prices, we pay with our privacy and often our dignity.  Insofar as competition to innovate, that is nonexistent in the case of Meta. 
By definition, when Instagram came along, this should have forced Meta to invest in making their picture sharing better. It didn't, it instead 
forced them to buy Instagram as, years later, it did with Whats app.  Why bother putting the hard work of innovating if the public is left with 
only one choice?</p>
