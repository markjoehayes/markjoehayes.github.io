        <p>Continued through &quot;The Odin Project&quot; and am ready to start the javascript fundamentals. Learned more details with CSS including the box model and placing cleaner margins, etc.</p>
        <p>In so far as C, am slowly pluggin along doing toy problems for excercise.</p>

        <h2>13 OCT 2024</h2>
         <p>This week, the most important thing I learned was how to get a very basic website up with HTML and CSS (You're looking at it). That's not all. This week's accomplishments are:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>A very basic website to start with and improve weekly.</li>
             <li>Restarted the foundations section of &quot;The Odin Project&quot;</li>
             <li>Reviewd the basics of the C programming languages - where I am stuck learning about arrays and pointers.</li>       
         </ul>
         <p>Hopefully, I will have a lot more to share next week as I progress through &quot;TOP&quot; and self-learn in C.</p>
