		<h3>Forgive me father, it&#39s been a long time</h3>
		<p>Over the last few months I have started Holberton Coding school. We have been coding in C and are almost done. I will start my final project next week, which is to write a simple shell. Currently I am reviewing past material - mostly trying to wrap my head around dynamic memory allocation and when to use it. Tomorrow I will start our current projects which is binary trees and searching algorithms.</p>
		 <p>Also, on my own time, I want to pick back up on the Odin Project -I will start either tonight or tomorrow, even if only do one hour per day, I want to have a regular commitment. </p>

        <p>This week, I began the javascript fundamentals.  I learned string methods and that they are not very different from python.  Also went through some basic flow controls (if, then, else) and displayed text in the console as well as alert boxes.  This coming week, I plan to continue on with javascript and start to improve the UI of this website.</p>        
        <h2>20 OCT 2024</h2>
        <p>Continued through &quot;The Odin Project&quot; and am ready to start the javascript fundamentals. Learned more details with CSS including the box model and placing cleaner margins, etc.</p>
        <p>In so far as C, am slowly pluggin along doing toy problems for excercises.</p>

        <h2>13 OCT 2024</h2>
         <p>This week, the most important thing I learned was how to get a very basic website up with HTML and CSS (You're looking at it). That's not all. This week's accomplishments are:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>A very basic website to start with and improve weekly.</li>
             <li>Restarted the foundations section of &quot;The Odin Project&quot;</li>
             <li>Reviewed the basics of the C programming languages - where I am stuck learning about arrays and pointers.</li>       
         </ul>
         <p>Hopefully, I will have a lot more to share next week as I progress through &quot;TOP&quot; and self-learn in C.</p>
