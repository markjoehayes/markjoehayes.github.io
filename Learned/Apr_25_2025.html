	 <h3>Even Better Week!</h3>
	 <p>This week, I am done with C at Holberton.  I passed the final interview and finished my project! However, I intend to keep going with C.  I want to eventually get into asm and real low-level stuff - as a hobbyist only, though. I have 3 days with no assignments, I want to do the later projects from the book: <i>Tiny C Projects</i> as well as start the nand to tetris project. It looks like we are doing a lot of python, starting Monday. This should give me plenty of time to work on my side goals.</p>
	 <p>As far as the interview went, it was much easier than I anticipated - it always is!  However, there was one really simple question that I knew and still stumbled with - he wanted me to use a for loop and print the alphabet on a line. I had a terrible start, but passed.  I really have to work on controlling my nerves and upping my confidence.</p>
	 <p>So, what did I learn this week? I tried to focus mostly on review and finish my shell project, but I did manage to get some new concepts in. Specifically randomizing in C.  Apparently, in C (all languages?) nothing can be truly random - even with rand() from stdlib.h,  the number choices will the same each time you run the program on the same mation.  To get around that, I learned to use a seed number, specifically through time() from time.h, which defaults through Unix Epoch Time. As long there is a second between runs, the number will be different and <i>mostly</i>random. </p>
